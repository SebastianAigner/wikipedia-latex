#Description
Wikipedia-LaTeX is a userscript that allows you to easily copy formulas from wikipedia. Next to each formula, the script adds a little **+** icon. Clicking it reveals the LaTeX source behind the formula. No more switching to the "Edit from source" tab just to figure out what symbol was used!

#Usage
Just add the file linked above to your favorite userscript manager, for example [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net) for Firefox, or [Tampermonkey](http://www.greasespot.net) for Chrome and Safari!

#Why?
I ran into a lot of formulas when studying for my upcoming exams, and I usually write my summaries in LaTeX, I thought there should be an easier way to access the formulas published on Wikipedia.

#How?
As it turns out, Wikipedia already delivers the plain text LaTeX version of the formulas alongside the rendered PNGs. All I do is extract them, and attach them to the little plus next to each formula.
